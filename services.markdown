### Introduction 

The following are some of our service offering:

#### Integrating with Google Suite

We can help you automate the data collection using Google tools, store them in Google Drive and automatically create Google documents and if required email them to a list of Google contacts. All the process can be event triggered or schedule automatically.

#### Integrating into DevOps practices

We can help automate the infrastructure build by integrating with configuration management (Ansible) and continuos integration tool such as Jenkins, TeamCity. We can also schedule database reporting, cleanup, and provisioning automatically or in a self-service manner.

#### Data Analysis

Every organisation needs data. We can help you automate the process of loading data by sourcing them from different feeds and databases. We can also help redact personal identifiable information to ensure data privacy and security. The data can be loaded into Microsoft Excel for users to perform analysis and reporting.

#### Data Collection

We can minimise the need to hire data entry personnel to input data manually from paper based. With combination of optical character recognition (OCR) technology, we can convert the documents into text-based. And, with customised program and tools, we can store the data into your choice of repository - cloud-based storage, databases, and spreadsheets.

#### Reports

Automate the creation of customised static web-pages so that information can be easily accessible by users. This also minimise the need to expose the data sources to users, minimizing the risk of data security attacks.

#### Self-service Bots

Develop internal bots to process certain tasks on a triggered event. For instance, by uploading a document to the cloud drive (Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive), it will automatically initiate an strings of tasks and processes.
